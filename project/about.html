    <p>Ferrari CAR <mark>Founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari (1898,
      1988), the company built its first car in 1940, adopted its current name in 1945, and began to produce
       its current line of road cars in 1947</mark></p>
       <p>Ferrari has a rich racing history and is a well known premium automobile brand. 
        The fastest street Ferrari is the F50 GT1, which can go over 370 kph (about 222 mph). 
        The most powerful Ferrari is the FXX, which has about 800 horsepower. 
        The FXX is a lighter, improved version of the F60 Enzo; it is Ferrari's most exclusive model. 
        It is basically a race car that you can buy from Ferrari. 
        The automobile is so extreme (completely flat tires, low ride height, 
        and no roadcar safety features such as Airbags) that it cannot be driven
         on roads legally. Ferrari will keep it for you at their Factory in Maranello 
         in Italy. You can go to Italy and drive it on their private race track,
          or have it transported to another race track around the world, 
          the same as if you were driving for a racing team. 
          Thirty have been built and all but two were sold to customers for $2,500,000 each. </p>
