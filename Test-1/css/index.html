        Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: 
        a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc.
         In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. 
         A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). 
         Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, 
         because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.
